The Slang Translator is a Android based application solution which is useful for any person who wants ease in their life and do not want to offend people if it is used about other people or outside a group of people who know each other well. Slang is very informal language. Now you have to type in Textfield. This has the ability to translate slang language into understandable language.

for eg:

Enter Message like "Hey Rishabh brb!!" 

Result would be --> Hey Rishabh Be Right Back.

Plus, point of using this Application is that It will be really helpful for specially-abled people or for normal users who don't know about the Slang word.
It is the faster and flexible user device interface medium.
